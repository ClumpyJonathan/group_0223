Changelog Monday 02 March 10:20pm
- Danial suggested that events should have a static variable to keep track of the number of existing events
- And that way they can assign their own ID when they are created
- instead of EventCreator keeping track and assigning them an ID

- Danial also suggested having Series/Memos/Alerts etc track the ID of the event they are associated with
- As opposed to keeping a reference to the event they are associated with

- Changes discussed over facebook chat
